*Date*: Date proposal was created on 11/30/2022.


## Motivation
This Project is about the branded cars that are placed in an auction in US. This project helps the buyers and sellers to find the average selling price, Cars sold and briefing about the count of particular colour cars.

## Investigative Questions
1. What is the average selling price of a particular car model?
2. What is the number of cars sold in a state?
3. What is the count of a particular colour car sold by a particular brand?

## Approach

Using csv reader we are going to read the data form the csv files. we are going create a python file and corresponding test file for each investigative question. we will be creating methods for reading the file, retrieving the data and transformation of that retrieved data to the desired output.
